                        <li>ICSPVCE 2019 follows a double blind review system. Authors should not include their names and affiliations in the manuscript or in any supplementary material. Authors should also ensure that their identity is not revealed indirectly (avoid acknowledgements to collaborators, funding agencies, revealing citations to author's previous work or links to websites that identify any of the authors. These may be done in the camera ready version).</li>
                        <li>The manuscript should be uploaded as a PDF file. LaTeX is preferred for typesetting. LaTeX template files are available for download <a href='#'>here.</a> Use the word template only in case you are unable to use LaTeX. The maximum allowed file size is 20MB.</li>
                        <li>The manuscript should be at most 8 pages in length (including all text, figures). One additional page may be used for References. Submissions that do not satisfy the length restriction may be desk rejected. Further, authors should ensure that the paper length is commensurate with the content.</li>
                        <li>Optional supplementary material containing images, movies and additional documents can be uploaded as a single .zip archive. The maximum allowed file size is 30MB.</li>
                        <li>All manuscripts must be submitted at the Microsoft CMT submission portal on or before the paper deadline. The portal can be accessed <a href='#'>here.</a></li>

                        <li>The paper ID must be included in the manuscript before uploading it on the portal. Paper ID may be created on CMT by entering the title, abstract, and subject areas.</li>
                        <li>We will have an early decision phase, where each submission will be scrutinized by an Area Chair, who will recommend if it should be assigned to reviewers for a detailed review. Papers that are clearly out of scope or well below acceptance thresholds will be rejected at this stage.</li>
